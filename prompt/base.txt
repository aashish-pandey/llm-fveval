You are given a SystemVerilog RTL module.

Your task is to generate SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA) that are
STRICTLY compatible with commercial formal verification tools
(e.g., Cadence JasperGold).

RULES (MANDATORY):
1. Output ONLY SystemVerilog code. No explanations, comments, or text.
2. Assertions MUST be syntactically valid IEEE SystemVerilog.
3. Assertions MUST reference ONLY signals declared in the given module.
4. Do NOT invent, rename, or assume any signals.
5. Each assertion MUST:
   - Use an explicit clock: @(posedge clk)
   - Use disable iff (!rst_n)
6. Assertions MUST be written inside a SystemVerilog module.
7. Do NOT include initial blocks, always blocks, or procedural code.
8. Do NOT modify or restate the RTL.
9. Use simple, single-condition safety properties only.
10. If unsure, output FEWER assertions rather than incorrect ones.

Output format MUST be:

module llm_assertions;
  // assertions here
endmodule
